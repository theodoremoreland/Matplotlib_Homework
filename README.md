# Pymaceuticals

Data analytics using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The data features 250 mice that were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. This project aims to compare the affects of various treatments. The end results feature the following:
* A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

# Conclusions
* Ramicane had the greatest affect in reducing tumor growth between drugs. Ramicane is one of only two drugs that acheived an overall tumor reduction.

* Mice given Propriva were the least likely to survive the 45 days; these mice had a survival rate of 26%, which is 22% below the median.

* Ramicane maintained the fewest number of metastatic sites across the 45 days, ending with approximately 200% less than Mice treated with Ketapril.
